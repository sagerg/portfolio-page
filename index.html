              College project in my web development class. We were tasked to
              create a static website from the ground-up. We were not allowed to
              use js frameworks or bootstrap, otherwise I would have made it in
              create-react-app:

              Personal side project to store passwords. Wanted to have a
              convenient cmd line tool to store passwords for accounts on a
              quick whim. Passwords are encrypted using XOR bitwise operations
              (bit flipping with mod).

              questions. If you're interested in learning about how their algos
              work, I've written down some comments in their respective src
              codes and it may (or may not) go through each line (some don't
              have any comments like fibonacci because those are
              self-explanatory I think).

              Collection of my personal attempts at project euler. Most are
              written in html/js format because I like to see the chrome V8
              engine work to find the recursive result of a big number and use
              up all my RAM.
