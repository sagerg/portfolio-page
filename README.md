# Portfolio Page [Version 2]

## Development

Version 1 was developed using only HTML/CSS. Having to rely on Bootstrap and [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/), it was difficult to maintain the code and to add dynamic features to the site. There was also some JavaScript bloat, making the page animations load very slowly on some machines on-scroll.

Version 2 is now live and was developed using more modern frameworks such as React and Material UI. Testing was done using Jest and Enzyme, standard packages that come along with Create-React-App. My portfolio is now an SPA. The page is minimalist by choice as I aimed to reduce overall text and images from the old site while keeping external links to the individual projects themselves. I believe this allows the viewer to spend less time scrolling and more time understanding my work experience and technical aptitude.

## Next Steps

I'm aiming to migrate this React app on another hosting environment. And if a backend is needed, I'd like to develop it with React Router and Python Flask.
