# Portfolio Website Version 2

Check it out here >> **[HERE](https://sagerg.github.io/)**.

## Development

Version 1 of this portfolio was developed using only HTML/CSS. Content formatting was done with Bootstrap CDN. Fade animations were done by AOS which you can see [here](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/).

The current version (V2) is now an SPA. It was developed using Create-React-App and Material UI. Pre-deployment testing was done with Jest and Enzyme.

## Next Steps

In the future, I'd like to migrate this SPA into a different hosting environment other than Github Pages. If there is a need for a backend, I'd like to set up a React Router and APIs written in Flask.
