# This Is My Portfolio Website

The site is currently live **[HERE](https://sagerg.github.io/)**.

## Development

This website was developed using plain HTML/CSS and some vanilla JavaScript. Content formatting was
done with Bootstrap CDN earlier, but I opted to use npm to locally host the necessary modules such as
popper and jquery. Fade animations are utilizing the AOS library which you can see [here](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/).

## ToDo

I plan to transition this bare bones Bootstrapped HTML one-page portfolio to a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) package.
